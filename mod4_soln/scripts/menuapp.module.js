  // Hint: The home state will not need a controller. Just a template.

  // Hint: The categories state can have a controller as well as a resolve. The resolve will use the MenuDataService to retrieve categories and inject them into the controller. The controller can then expose the retrieved categories object such that it can be simply passed into the categories component.

  // Hint: The items state can have the same type of setup as the categories state.
